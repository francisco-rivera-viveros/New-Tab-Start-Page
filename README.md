# Start-Page
This is my very own and personal Customize Start Page I want it to share it with you guys so I published it on Chrome Web Store  

You can use it on whatever Browser you like! well chromium based but you know!

You will have to download both the Theme on Chrome Web Store ðŸ‘‰ https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mi-tema-personalizado/ejmojopnefpgmonpelcmlldmodegagca?hl=es
and the Extension to change the New Tab Page on Chrome Web Store ðŸ‘‰https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mi-p%C3%A1gina-de-inicio-perso/ahgbkchcjlamboblchihkdjmoialmaea?hl=es

So this is how it looks like !! (Remember to install both! Theme & Extension!)

You may be wondering why 2? Can't you put them both on the same extension so we just have to download one and boom you have the setup?, well let me tell you seems like Google doesn't allow to have a theme (that modifies tab's color and so on) and a extension that automaically changes your New Tab Page cause you know someone could put some random stuff on a theme extension so that will be bad to users SOO i get it Google it's actually a nice security feature soo the sacrifice that we have to make it's have them separated into 2 different extensions!
